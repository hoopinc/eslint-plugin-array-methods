# eslint-plugin-array-methods

eslint rules that allow you to forbid usage of any of the `Array` methods.

The recommended configuration forbids methods added to JavaScript recently (> ~2020ish).

Inspiration taken from the more specialized [eslint-plugin-no-array-reduce](https://github.com/mkosir/eslint-plugin-no-array-reduce).
